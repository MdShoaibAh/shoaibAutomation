This sampling method generates biased data. Use data from a random sample to draw inferences about a population with an unknown characteristic of interest. Generate multiple samples (or simulated samples) of the same size to gauge the variation in estimates or predictions. For example, estimate the mean word length in a book by randomly sampling words from the book ;  predict the winner of a school election based on randomly sampled survey data. Gauge how far off the estimate or prediction might be."
